title: "Part 10 - Saving and loading"

        <p>
            Saving and loading is essential to almost every roguelike, but it can be a pain to manage if you don't start
        early. By the end of this chapter, our game will be able to save and load one file to the disk, which you
        could easily expand to multiple saves if you wanted to. But before we get into that, let's focus on our main
        game loop.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code>engine.py</code> file is about 250 lines long right now. In the grand scheme of things, that
        really isn't that bad (I've worked on files that are 10,000 lines long), but let's face it: a lot of what's
        in there doesn't need to be. Furthermore, the <code>main</code> function could be broken up into
        initialization and the main game loop, which will make saving and loading that much easier.
        </p>

        <p>
        The first step is to move the initialization of the variables outside the main game loop as much as we can.
        We'll create a few functions that will do things like create the player, create the map, and load variables
        like <code>map_width</code> and <code>fov_algorithm</code>. Let's create a new folder called
        <code>loader_functions</code>, and put a new file in it called <code>initialize_new_game.py</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our first function in this new file will return the variables that are currently at the top of the
        <code>main</code> function. It looks like this:
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>*Note: <code>window_title</code> is new. Before, we were just passing the title of the window as
            a string, but we might as well define it as part of this dictionary.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
        Why the name "constants"? Python doesn't have a way to declare a variable that never changes (Java has
        "final", C# has "readonly", etc.), so I wanted a name that conveys the fact that these variable's
        <i>shouldn't</i> change. The program <i>could, theoretically</i> alter them during the course of the game,
        but for now, we won't do that. You can use another name if you prefer, like "game_variables" or something
        to that effect.
        </p>

        <p>
        Let's put this function to work in our <code>engine.py</code> file. Import the function first:
        </p>


        <pre>...
from input_handlers import handle_keys, handle_mouse
<span style="color: green">from loader_functions.initialize_new_game import get_constants</span>
from map_objects.game_map import GameMap
...</pre>

        <p>
        Then, call it in the first line of <code>main</code>. Let's also remove those same variables :
        </p>

            <pre>def main():
    <span style="color: green">constants = get_constants()</span>

    <span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through">}</span></pre>

            <p>
            Okay, so if you're using an IDE (like PyCharm), then it's probably going crazy right now. Obviously we
            can't just remove that many variables and expect everything to be just fine. We have to modify all the times
            we used those "constant" variables directly, and replace then with a lookup to the <code>constants</code>
            dictionary.

            <p>
            <i>*Note: Why are we using the square bracket notation instead of the <code>get()</code> method? In most
                other spots, we've used the 'get' notation, but here I would argue it makes more sense to use the
                square brackets. Square brackets will outright crash our game if the variable isn't found, which in
                this case, is probably what we'd want. The game can't possibly proceed without these variables, so
                there's no reason to try to continue the program without them.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
            That's a lot of changes, but we've successfully removed the constant variables out of the main loop! Note
            that if you wanted to, you could shorten a <i>lot</i> of those function definitions by just passing the
            <code>constants</code> dictionary instead of passing only what the functions need. It doesn't make a huge
            difference and is really a matter of preference. I'll leave it as is in this tutorial, since changing
            the functions right now would be a ton of work.
            </p>

            <p>
            What's next? Another thing we could do is move the initialization of the player, entities list, and
            game's map to a separate function. Put the following function in <code>initialize_new_game.py</code>:
            </p>

            <pre>def get_constants():
    ...

<span style="color: green">def get_game_variables(constants):
    fighter_component = Fighter(hp=30, defense=2, power=5)
    inventory_component = Inventory(26)
    player = Entity(0, 0, '@', libtcod.white, 'Player', blocks=True, render_order=RenderOrder.ACTOR,
                    fighter=fighter_component, inventory=inventory_component)
    entities = [player]

    game_map = GameMap(constants['map_width'], constants['map_height'])
    game_map.make_map(constants['max_rooms'], constants['room_min_size'], constants['room_max_size'],
                      constants['map_width'], constants['map_height'], player, entities,
                      constants['max_monsters_per_room'], constants['max_items_per_room'])

    message_log = MessageLog(constants['message_x'], constants['message_width'], constants['message_height'])

    game_state = GameStates.PLAYERS_TURN

    return player, entities, game_map, message_log, game_state</span></pre>

        <p>
            We'll need to include a few imports in <code>initialize_new_game.py</code> for this:
        </p>

        <pre>import tcod as libtcod

<span style="color: green">from components.fighter import Fighter

from map_objects.game_map import GameMap

from render_functions import RenderOrder</span>


def get_constants():
    ...</pre>

            <p>
            Nothing has changed about the way we're initializing these variables. All we're doing is putting it in
            one function, which we'll call once in our main game loop. Let's do that now. Start by importing the
            <code>get_game_variables</code> function:
            </p>

            <pre>...
from input_handlers import handle_keys, handle_mouse
from loader_functions.initialize_new_game import get_constants, <span style="color: green">get_game_variables</span>
from map_objects.game_map import GameMap
...</pre>

            <p>
            Then modify the <code>main</code> function like this:

            <p>
            One interesting effect of removing these lines is that we don't need all the imports we did before.
            Modify your import section at the top of <code>engine.py</code> to look like this:

        <p>
            It's time to think about how we're going to save and load our game. In order for this to happen, we'll
            need to save some (not necessarily all) of our data to some sort of persistent external location. In many
            applications, this would be a SQL or NoSQL database, but that's probably overkill for our little project.
            Instead, we'll just save to a data file.
        </p>

        <p>
            So what exactly do we need to save? The key things are the entities list (including the player), the game's
            map, the message log, and the game's state. These are the same variables we got from the game's
            initialization function too, so we'll be able to start a new game or load an old one by just swapping
            our the respective functions. More on that later.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, plain JSON isn't quite enough to save and load our data. Our objects are too complex to just
            save to straight JSON. There are a few solutions to this. The first would be to write serializers for our
            classes and objects ourselves, which isn't a bad idea. But in the interest of keeping things simple for this
            tutorial, we'll just use a library; specifically: <code>shelve</code>. This library allows you to save
            and load complex Python objects, without needing to write custom serializers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Install <code>shelve</code> in your Python installation (pip is the best way). Then, create a new
            file in <code>loader_functions</code>, called <code>data_loaders.py</code>. We'll start by writing our
            save function.
        </p>

        <pre><span style="color: green">import shelve


def save_game(player, entities, game_map, message_log, game_state):
    with shelve.open('savegame.dat', 'n') as data_file:
        data_file['player_index'] = entities.index(player)
        data_file['entities'] = entities
        data_file['game_map'] = game_map
        data_file['message_log'] = message_log
        data_file['game_state'] = game_state</span></pre>

        <p>
            Using <code>shelve</code>, we're encoding the data into a dictionary which we'll save to the file
            later. Note that we're not actually saving the <code>player</code>, because the
            player is already part of the <code>entities</code> list. We just need the index in the list, so that
            we can load the player from that list later.
        </p>

        <p>
            And that's all we need to save the game! Without the <code>shelve</code> module, it would have taken
            far more effort to be able to save our game. Luckily, it also makes loading our game easy too; let's
            implement that now. In the same file (<code>data_loaders.py</code>), create a new function called
            <code>load_game</code>. You'll need to import <code>GameMap</code> in order for this to work.
        </p>

        <pre><span style="color: green">import os</span>

import shelve


def save_game(player, entities, game_map, message_log, game_state):
    ...

<span style="color: green">def load_game():
    if not os.path.isfile('savegame.dat'):
        raise FileNotFoundError

    with shelve.open('savegame.dat', 'r') as data_file:
        player_index = data_file['player_index']
        entities = data_file['entities']
        game_map = data_file['game_map']
        message_log = data_file['message_log']
        game_state = data_file['game_state']

    player = entities[player_index]

    return player, entities, game_map, message_log, game_state</span></pre>

        <p>
            This is just the reverse of the save function. We pull the data out of the data file, and return all the
            variables needed to the engine.
        </p>

        <p>
            The functions for saving and loading are done, but now we need a way to use them. Before we do that,
            it's probably a good time to think about how our game starts up in the first place. Right now, the game
            just starts, throwing the player straight into a new game. But that's not how games typically work. Almost
            every game in existence has some sort of starting screen, which lets the player start a new game, load
            an existing one, exit, or maybe edit some options. Let's implement something similar for ours; we should
            let the player start a new game, load an existing one, or quit.
        </p>

        <p>
            We'll need a new menu function to display our main menu. Open up <code>menus.py</code> and add the following
            function to it:
        </p>


        <pre>def inventory_menu(con, header, inventory, inventory_width, screen_width, screen_height):
    ...


<span style="color: green">def main_menu(con, background_image, screen_width, screen_height):
    libtcod.image_blit_2x(background_image, 0, 0, 0)

    libtcod.console_set_default_foreground(0, libtcod.light_yellow)
    libtcod.console_print_ex(0, int(screen_width / 2), int(screen_height / 2) - 4, libtcod.BKGND_NONE, libtcod.CENTER,
                             'TOMBS OF THE ANCIENT KINGS')
    libtcod.console_print_ex(0, int(screen_width / 2), int(screen_height - 2), libtcod.BKGND_NONE, libtcod.CENTER,
                             'By (Your name here)')

    menu(con, '', ['Play a new game', 'Continue last game', 'Quit'], 24, screen_width, screen_height)</span></pre>

        <p>
            Our "main" function right now operates off the assumption that we're going straight into the game. A better
        method of handling this would be to have the "main" function open the main menu, and, if the player chooses
        to either start a new game or continue an old one, the main game starts. We can move the logic of the main
        game to a separate function, which we'll call <code>play_game</code>. This function will live in our
            <code>engine.py</code> file (it doesn't have to, but it doesn't make much sense to put it elsewhere right
        now).</p>

        <p>
            This is the same as our game code from before, just put into a function. We'll pass all the needed
            variables in our <code>main</code> function. If the player presses escape during the game, we'll return
            to the main loop, which displays the main menu. The one thing that is different here is that we're calling
            <code>save_game</code> before exiting the loop.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now let's change our main loop. It'll display the main menu, and depending on the player's choice,
            it will either start a new game, load an existing one, or exit the program.
        </p>

        <pre>def main():

            play_game(player, entities, game_map, message_log, game_state, con, panel, constants)

        <p>
            We're loading a background image with <code>image_load</code> to display in our main menu. The sample image
            used for this tutorial can be
            <a href="http://roguecentral.org/doryen/files/menu_background1.png">found here</a>. Download it and put
            in in your project's directory.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other than that, a lot of this should look familiar. We're displaying the main menu with three options,
            and accepting keyboard input to determine which option to go with. If the user starts a new game, we
            use our <code>get_game_variables</code> function from earlier, and if an old game is being loaded,
            we use the <code>load_game</code> function. Either way, we get the same variables. Assuming one of those
            options was chosen, we pass the variables off to the <code>play_game</code> function, and the game proceeds
            as it has been until now.
        </p>

        <p>
            We haven't implemented the <code>message_box</code> or <code>handle_main_menu</code> functions yet, so let's
            do so now. We'll start with <code>message_box</code> and we'll put it in <code>menus.py</code>, at the
            bottom of the file:
        </p>

        <pre><span style="color: green">def message_box(con, header, width, screen_width, screen_height):
    menu(con, header, [], width, screen_width, screen_height)</span></pre>

        <p>
            Pretty straightforward. The message box is just an empty menu, basically.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now on to <code>handle_main_menu</code>, which goes in <code>input_handlers.py</code>:
        </p>

        <pre>def handle_inventory_keys(key):
    ...

<span style="color: green">def handle_main_menu(key):
    key_char = chr(key.c)

    if key_char == 'a':
        return {'new_game': True}
    elif key_char == 'b':
        return {'load_game': True}
    elif key_char == 'c' or  key.vk == libtcod.KEY_ESCAPE:
        return {'exit': True}

    return {}</span>


def handle_mouse(mouse):
    ...</pre>

        <p>
            Nothing too complicated here: Our main menu will have 3 options, so just return the result of which option
            was selected. Note that the 'Quit' option can be done through the 'c' key or 'Escape'.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember to import these new functions into <code>engine.py</code>:
        </p>

        <pre>import tcod as libtcod

from death_functions import kill_monster, kill_player
from entity import get_blocking_entities_at_location
from fov_functions import initialize_fov, recompute_fov

<span style="color: green">from menus import main_menu, message_box</span>
from render_functions import clear_all, render_all
...</pre>

        <p>
            That's all for this chapter. The gameplay itself hasn't changed, but saving and loading is no small feat.
            Be proud!
