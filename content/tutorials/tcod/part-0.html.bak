    <h4>Prior knowledge</h4>

    <p>
        This tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with programming in general,
        and with Python. If you've never used Python before, this tutorial could
        be a little confusing. There are many free resources online about learning
        programming and Python (too many to list here), and I'd recommend learning
        about objects and functions in Python at the very least before attempting
        to read this tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
        ... Of course, there are those who have ignored this advice and done
        well with this tutorial anyway, so feel free to ignore that last paragraph
        if you're feeling bold!
    </p>

    <h4>Installation</h4>

    <p>
        To do this tutorial, you'll need Python version 3.5 or higher. The latest
        version of Python is recommended (currently 3.7 as of March 2019).
        <strong>Note: Python 2 is not compatible.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download Python here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        You'll also want the latest version of the TCOD library, which is what
        this tutorial is based on.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html">
            Installation instructions for TCOD can be found here.
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        While you can certainly install TCOD and complete this tutorial without it,
        I'd highly recommend using a virtual environment.
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">Documentation on
        how to do that can be found here.</a>
    </p>

    <h4>Editors</h4>

    <p>
        Any text editor can work for writing Python. You could even use Notepad if you
        really wanted to. Personally, I'm a fan of
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Pycharm</a> and
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. Whatever you
        choose, I strongly recommend something that can help catch Python syntax
        errors at the very least. I've been working with Python for over five years,
        and I still make these types of mistakes all the time!
    </p>

    <h4>Making sure Python works</h4>

    <p>
        To verify that your installation of both Python 3 and TCOD are working,
        create a new file (in whatever directory you plan on using for the tutorial)
        called <code>engine.py</code>, and enter the following text into it:
    </p>

    <pre>import tcod as libtcod


def main():
    print('Hello World!')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</pre>

    <p>
        Run the file in your terminal (or alternatively in your editor, if possible):
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>python engine.py</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're not using <code>virtualenv</code>, the command will probably look
        like this:
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>python3 engine.py</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        You should see "Hello World!" printed out to the terminal. If you receive an
        error, there is probably an issue with either your Python or TCOD installation.
    </p>

    <h3>Downloading the Image File</h3>

    <p>
        For this tutorial, we'll need an image file. The default one is provided below.
    </p>

    <img src="/images/arial10x10.png">

    <p>
        Right click the image and save it to the same directory that you're planning on
        placing your code in. If the above image is not displaying for some reason,
        it is also
